Breaking, building, and securing systems â€” hands-on network and security labs with a touch of technical empathy
## Welcome!

Welcome to my personal sandbox for building, breaking, and understanding how to set up and secure systems and networks.  
This is a collection of hands-on labs where I'm building my networking and security skills.  

Beyond code, this repo showcases how I critically think to structure and solve problems using what I like to call **"technical empathy."**  
Each lab contains objectives, walkthroughs, lessons learned, and problems solved through the CLI, research, and thoughtful documentation.  
This is part of a larger technology career growth plan (e.g. Azure, CCNA, AWS).  
I hope you enjoy!
